# Let's Get Rafty

This project is a series of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems with a goal to build a curated list of exercise for hackers who enjoy building things. 

Please keep your repository private when forking, and avoid sharing solutions publicly. Thanks ! ‚ù§Ô∏è

## What

This is the project with an idea to feature a range of write-ups and exercises on distributed systems for beginners. It supposed to offer a grasp overview of the space. If you've ever been curious about how [distributed file systems](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) function or wanted to explore the inner workings of [your favorite RPC framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift). Then, it's the right place here because you will build a fully functioning toy version of that yourself.

The exercises are mostly isolated units of work covering a particular topic. Each of the exercise comes with boilerplate implementation in C++ which you need to adjust.

*Why the name is "Getrafty"? That appeared to me as a funny game of words. One of the crucial concept touched in the tutorials the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)*.
