# Getrafty

This project aims to provide a variety of write-ups and exercises on distributed backend systems, offering an overview of the basic concepts. 
Whether you've been curious about how [distributed file systems](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) function or wanted to explore the inner workings of [your favorite RPC framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift), you're in the right place. 
Here, you'll have the opportunity to build a fully functional toy version yourself.

The exercises are mainly standalone tasks, each focusing on a specific topic. Every exercise includes a C++ boilerplate implementation that you will need to modify.

Please keep your forked repository private and refrain from sharing your solutions publicly. Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

*How did "Getrafty" get its name? I found it to be an amusing twist on words. One of the main concepts touched on in the workbook is the [Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)*.
