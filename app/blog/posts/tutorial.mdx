This tutorial is a quick walkthrough for getting the code used in Getrafty articles up and running.

## Getting The Code

To work with the code make a private fork of [getrafty-org/getrafty](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty.git) and clone it:

```shell
~/$ git clone git@github.com:<username>/getrafty.git
```

Getrafty comes with `Dockerfile` so you don't need to install compilers and toolchains on your machine. 
Any Docker compatible container runtime should work. 
Also, Getrafty's got a handy command line tool that does all the heavy lifting. 
For example, to boot a container with an open `3333` ssh port:

```shell
~/$ ./tasklet boot
```

Then to connect: 

```shell
~/$ ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 3333 
```

Or simply:

```shell
~/$ ./tasklet attach
```

## 🧠 Task

Have you ever watched BTTF since fiction movie? It introduces famous car by DeLorean Motor Company that is capable of traveling in time. 

According to the plot, the vehicle integrated with so-called [flux capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine#Operation) needed to reach certain speed before capacitor let the sport car to break time barrier.

This task is about completing the method `FluxCapacitor::computeTimeBarrierBreakSpeed` in [`flux_capacitor.cpp`](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty/blob/main/tasks/tutorial/flux_capacitor.cpp).

```cpp
// flux_capacitor.cpp:
Speed FluxCapacitor::computeTimeBarrierBreakSpeed() {
    ...
};
```

The method returns a minimum speed in mph needed to [activate the flux capacitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine#Operation).

## 📦 Build & Test

Getrafty's C++ modules are built with [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake). Tests usually live next to the source files, for example: [`flux_capacitor.cpp`](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty/blob/main/tasks/tutorial/flux_capacitor_test.cpp). 

You can run tests directly through the CMake toolchain using any of [pre-configured profiles](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty/blob/main/cmake-variants.yaml) or using `tasklet` CLI.

To get the list of all exercises:
```shell
~/$ ./tasklet list

tutorial
...
```

To run tests for every build profile right out of the box:

```shell
~/$ ./tasklet test tutorial

OK all tests passed
```

If the test command prints OK, most likely everything works as expected.
