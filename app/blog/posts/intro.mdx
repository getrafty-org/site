summary: "Build fully functional toy versions of distributed systems. Learn through hands-on C++ exercises covering file systems, RPC frameworks, and more."
---

Whether you've been curious about how [distributed file systems](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/gfs-sosp2003.pdf) function or wanted to explore the inner workings of [your favorite RPC framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Thrift), you're in the right place.
Here, you'll have the opportunity to build a fully functional toy version yourself.

The exercises are mainly standalone tasks, each focusing on a specific topic. Every exercise includes a C++ (20) boilerplate implementation that you will need to modify.

## Contributing

This is a very early exploration that is yet to be proved to be useful; the contents are very immature and incomplete.  If you want to contribute, *you are very welcome*! [File an issue](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty/issues/new), and we will chat.
If you have found a bug, please create an issue (or pull request) [in the repository](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty).


## Working with source code

Make a private fork of the [repository](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty) and clone it:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<username>/getrafty.git
cd getrafty/tasks/tutorial
```


## Setting up dev environment

Launch dev container with configured development environment

```shell
./tasklet.py boot
```

The container is now running on port `3333` and accessible under `ubuntu` user. To continue in terminal login via `ssh ubuntu@localhost -p 3333` or simply `./tasklet.py attach`. It's recommended to configure an IDE of your choice.


## üß† Task

Your goal is to complete the method `FluxCapacitor::computeTimeBreakBarrierSpeed` in [`flux_capacitor.cpp`](https://github.com/getrafty-org/getrafty/blob/main/tasks/tutorial/flux_capacitor.cpp).

```cpp
// In flux_capacitor.cpp:
Speed FluxCapacitor::computeTimeBreakBarrierSpeed() {
    ...
};
```

The method should return a minimum speed (measured in miles per hour) for a DeLorean vehicle [to be able to travel in time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine#Operation).

## Testing

Ensure your code passes clang-tidy lints. Every task comes with tests, and you should be able to run it via [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/A%20Basic%20Starting%20Point.html).
